    description: 'An online platform where users can play number guessing games, watch ads, or complete quizzes to earn money.',
    detailedDescription: 'Shankura offers an engaging way for users to earn money by playing a number guessing game where a random set of five numbers is generated. Users can win money based on the number of matches, starting from three to five correct numbers. Additionally, users earn R5 upon account creation and R3 for each referral. The platform implements JWT for secure user authentication, including password hashing and verification codes for new accounts and password recovery. Routes are protected, ensuring users must log in to access features, and we are currently awaiting a response from AdSense regarding ad implementation.',
